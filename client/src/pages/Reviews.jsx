      <p>"I have been purchasing dog food from Pawsitivley Fresh for months now and I couldn't be happier with the quality and service. My dog has a sensitivity to chicken
        and finding the right food was a challenge, but the team at this store helped me find the perfect option. Highly Recommended ~ Debra H.".</p> <br />
      <p>"I recently switched my cat to a new brand of food from Pawsitivley Fresh and I have noticed a significant impovement in her coat and overall health.
        The customer service was fantastic and the delivery was quick. I will definitely be a returning customer!" ~ Jim L.</p> <br />
      <p>"I was thrilled to find Pawsitivley Fresh that offers a wide variety of dog and cat food options. The prices are competitive and the shipping
        is fast. My pets love the food and I love that I can easily order online and have it delivered right to my doorstep. 5 stars!" ~ Erin D.</p> <br />
